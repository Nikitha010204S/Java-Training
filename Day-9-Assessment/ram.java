/*Ram has just begun learning English Alphabet and has already started noticing interesting patterns with words he sees. 
He is able to quickly determine, if given a set of words, whether he can arrange them in a list in such a way that the first letter
of any word in that list is the same as the ending letter of the word before it in that list. Can you help him write a computer program 
which can help determine the same?
The input to the method canArrangeWords of class WordListOrder shall contain an array of words arr.
arr shall contain words consisting of lower-case letters between ‘a-‘z’ only(2<=length of each word in arr<=100)
Return 1 if the words in the list can be arranged in the fashion required and -1 if they cannot. In this arrangement, 
the first word in the list can begin with any letter and need not satisfy the constraint conditions.
 Make sure that your class and method are public. Do not accept any input from the console. They shall be provided as arguments to the method.

Useful Commands:
Length() method is used to calculate the length of a string.
inta=str.length();
stores the length of string str in a.
Similarly to calculate length of 1-D integer array, the statement
int a=arr.length;
Stores the length of arr in a.
