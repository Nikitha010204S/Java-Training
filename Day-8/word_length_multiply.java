/*Word Length Multiplication
Given a list of words, find the maximum value of the product of the lengths of two words from the list, subject to the constraint that 
the two words cannot share any letters. For instance, given the words ABCW, BAZ, FOO, BAR, XTFN, and ABCDEF, the pair FOO BAR has a product 
of 9, the pair BAZ XFTN has a product of 12, and the pair ABCW XTFN has a product of 16, which is the maximum. Note that the pair ABCW ABCDEF 
doesnâ€™t work because the two words share three letters

Input : ABCW BAZ FOO BAR XTFN ABCDEF

Output :16 */
